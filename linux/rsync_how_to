This little document will show you how to 
use rsync.

This is the command I use to backup my
svn directory

rsync -av /var/www/html/svn/ ~/data/backups/svn

The command above will copy all of the contents
of the svn folder (inside /var/www/html) to the
svn folder in the ~/data/backups/svn folder.

Note: the forward slash in the source directory
means that it will copy everything in it (including
the directories in the folder).

Paramters:
a - archive
v - verbose (show what is being copied over)
n - do nothing ... good for testing
