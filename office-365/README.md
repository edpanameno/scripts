## Office 365 Users
This directory has the list of random users (generated from [random user generator](https://randomuser.me){:target="_blank")) that I used to import into my local active directory domain that were then synched up with my Office 365 Developer tenant. You will also find the scripts I used to import the users into the active directory domain. There is also a script that randomly added users to the groups that I had previouly created in the domain.
